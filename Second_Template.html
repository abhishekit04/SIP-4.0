                <p> Dear Parents and Students, </p>

                <p> It is exciting and rewarding to serve as the principal of Ridgefield
                    High School! It is a <br>wonderful place to work, and I truly enjoy my
                    partnerships with faculty, parents, and <br>students. </p>

                <p> Our mission is to enable all students to become self-directed and self-reflective <br>
                    learners. In a climate of trust, we engage them
                    in opportunities to improve their <br> academic performance,
                    develop their interpersonal skills. It is important to me that <br>
                    all students feel that our staff knows them well and that we continue
                    to challenge <br>them to grow both academically and socially.</p>

                <p> We provide a nurturing environment in which students feel safe to
                    explore new <br> learning and challenges while still knowing there are
                    caring, supzwportive adults to <br> join in celebrating their success and
                    guiding them through difficult times. As partners<br> in our endeavor,
                    thank you for your support.</p>
